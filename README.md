I wrote this script in order to save 
the trouble of writing a series of 
commands while using the nmap tool.
This script is very powerful in 
scanning websites and IP addresses 
for vulnerabilities,
and if there are vulnerabilities 
that can be exploited, 
the exploitation will be done as well.
I would very much like to share
my simple work with you.
